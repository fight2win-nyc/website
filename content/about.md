## A RANK-AND-FILE CAUCUS OF CUNY’S PROFESSIONAL STAFF CONGRESS

FIGHT 2 WIN is a rank-and-file caucus in PSC-CUNY. We believe our power lies in the rank-and-file members of our union organizing collectively for shared goals. We advocate for a democratic, organized and strike-ready union—one that connects members through departmental and office structures and that bases its campaigns on grassroots energy and inclusive deliberation. We are organizing for a fully funded university, wages that meet New York City’s cost of living, for academic freedom, the right to assembly, and racial justice in both the university and the city beyond it.

## **What is a union caucus?**

A caucus is a group of like-minded union members who work together towards common goals to build power, like campaigns for better working conditions or running for union office. Any PSC-CUNY member who aligns with our points of unity can be a part of Fight 2 Win. Fight 2 Win is a caucus that creates union spaces workers want. We have run organizing trainings, open general meetings, socials, political education events, and more!

## **FIGHT 2 WIN envisions:**

* **A CUNY:**
  * led by its students and all workers, not provosts or politicians
  * that is free and fully-funded
  * where our wages beat inflation and keep up with the city’s cost of living
  * where adjuncts have job security and fair wages
  * where HEOs are shown the respect they deserve
  * where academic freedom and our right to assembly are protected
* **A Union:**
  * led by a deeply organized and active rank-and-file membership
  * that has the capacity and willingness to strike
  * that works to build a united front with other unions
  * that can fight back against fascism, repression, and the long defunding of higher education
  * that is richly democratic, from the chapter up
  * that does not shy away from political questions but engages them directly and democratically
  * where part-timers and HEOs are fully represented, not dominated by full-time faculty

## FIGHT TO WIN’s Points of Unity were decided at an assembly, where our caucus was founded, in November, 2024. They read:

1. We are committed to a participatory, democratic, militant, and anti-racist union in which decisions of the caucus are decided in popular assemblies and leaders are delegated to carry out these decisions.
2. We are committed to the struggle for a free Palestine and internationalism more broadly.
3. We are committed to our union’s right to strike.
4. We are committed to building strike readiness as a top priority.
5. Our caucus leaders will remain accountable to rank and file members.

Importantly, these are our democratically-decided points of unity, they guide our caucus’ actions, but they are new and subject to change and development; as we are dedicated to democracy, it is through democratic practice that our points of unity, our orientation and practice, changes and evolves.
