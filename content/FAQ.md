### What is a strike?

A strike is a collective work stoppage, when workers refuse to perform any labor related to their jobs. We could go on strike for a predetermined number of days or at predetermined locations or departments, or a strike could last for an indefinite length of time, depending on what the union collectively decides. In higher education, strikes involve stopping all university-related labor, including:

* Teaching a course in-person or online
* Giving assessments like tests, exams, or assignments
* Grading or submitting grades
* Teaching or grading for another instructor
* Conducting research as part of your employment
* Holding university events
* Attending or completing university-related administrative work
* Holding office hours
* Completing university trainings

The official strike process goes like this:

* First, a Strike Authorization Vote (SAV) must be called, either by the PSC Executive Council, or by a majority of delegates voting in favor of a SAV at the PSC Delegate Assembly.
* Once the vote is called, all PSC members will be asked to vote on whether to go on strike
* If at least 2/3 of everyone who participates in the vote says YES, then the union is authorized to call a strike
* The Executive Council must then decide if/when to actually call a strike.

A “wildcat strike” is when union members choose to go on strike without following the official strike process.

### Has the PSC ever gone on strike before?

The CUNY bargaining unit of the PSC has never gone on strike before, but we did pass a strike authorization vote in 2016, in which over 10,000 members voted, and 92% of them voted yes. This means more than half of all union members voted in favor of a strike.

In September 2020, PSC members at Hunter Campus Schools very nearly went on strike over Covid-19 safety, but CUNY met their demands the night before the strike was set to begin.

### Why should we go on strike?

A strike is a powerful way for a union and its members to win their demands, especially when management is refusing to take bargaining seriously. Striking reminds management that the university cannot run without our labor. Our teaching, research, service, and administrative work are at the heart of CUNY operations.

Even though our contract expired in February 2023, management is still dragging their feet on making any economic offers. Their vision for CUNY is one of austerity and precarity. CUNY remains understaffed and underfunded, raises don’t keep up with inflation, buildings are crumbling, and students remain saddled with increasing tuition fees and debt.

We need a new deal from the City, State, and CUNY Central. We need free tuition for students, and fair wages that keep up with cost-of-living. We cannot allow the university to continue to run under these conditions.

Other unions’ experiences show us that very often, a strike or a credible strike threat are the only ways to force management to make any meaningful movement on their proposals. If we want a strong contract, we must be willing and ready to use this tactic.

### What have other higher ed unions recently won using a strike or strike threat?

Higher education has seen a massive wave of strikes recently, and many of them have won big raises, including at public universities. Now is the time for CUNY to ride this wave.

Rutgers University (April 2023) – 43.7% raises for adjunct faculty,  14% raises for full-time faculty, and  36% raises for graduate assistants (bringing pay to $40k/year), over four years (by 2026)

Temple University (January – March 2023) – 40% raises for graduate assistants over four years (by 2026)

Fordham University (January 2023) – entry-level adjunct faculty teaching in the College of Arts and Sciences won annual raises averaging around 7% and will make $8,000 per 3-credit course by the end of the contract in Spring 2025. Adjuncts in the Graduate Schools of Social Service and Religion got much higher raises, bringing them closer to full parity. And this was just with a strike threat! This was more than double Fordham’s initial offer.

The New School (November – December 2022) – 22% raises for adjunct faculty teaching 3-credit lecture courses over the life of the contract, with higher raises for other course types

University of California (November-December 2022) – 46% raises for the lowest-paid graduate workers with teaching appointments (bringing pay to $34k by 2024), with higher raises for other types of appointments (with doctoral candidate teaching their own courses making as much as $45k in 2024)

NYU (November 2022) – adjuncts won immediate raises to $10,500 per 3-credit course and will receive $12,738 per 3-credit course in 2028 — with just a strike threat, no actual strike.

Eastern Michigan University (September 2022) — full-time faculty won immediate raises of $4,000, with an additional 6.6% over the following two years

Columbia University (October 2021-January 2022) — graduate assistants won an approximately 30% pay increase, resulting in graduate stipends of $41.6k by 2025
